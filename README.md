# Design
A collection of graphic design assets I've made for various projects. For the most part, these are shown in chronological order, from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom.

## FUCS Glyphs

This is a collection of computing-related icons made for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The bugs are intended as graphics for any debugging-themed events. Individual SVGs and PNGs of each are also available.

## FUCS Facebook Banner

The 2022 Facebook banner for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The blue version was created by me, while requesting feedback from others to guide each step of the process. The green & purple version was produced via later modifications by the club president. The font used is a modified version of Audiowide by Brian J. Bonislawsky, licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

## FUCS Logo

The 2022 logo for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The blue version was created by me, with significant feedback from others to guide each step of the process. The green & purple version was produced via later modifications by the club president.

## FUCS and FLASC Table Banners

Banners for the Flinders Uni Computer Society and FLinders Academic Science Club, to suspend above their stalls at O'Week and other similar events. FUCS' banner was made as an SVG with Inkscape, while FLASC's banner was made in Canva. Both were ordered together to reduce costs, printed on coreflute, with several copies made at no additional cost. The logo and background-glyphs for FLASC's banner were made by others, though I was involved in converting them to SVGs/etc and cleaning up the resulting messy files.

## FUCS Merchandise

Merchandise organised for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. I heard the slogan from someone else, forgot who, and then everyone I asked said it wasn't them. The designs for the front & back were developed by me with significant feedback from others to guide each step of the process, and the merch was printed by Topline Promotions on AS Colour clothes in a variety of colours & sizes (only some are shown here).

## FLASC Merchandise

Merchandise organised for the FLinders Academic Science Club. Two other designs were also printed, however they were primarily developed by others, with my only jobs being to convert them to SVG format so they could be printed, test out different colours, make previews, etc. This design was developed by me, with feedback from others along the way, and was based on the existing FLASC logo seen in the table-banner above. The multi-coloured colour scheme was adapted from the designs used for the club's 2019 'Drinking CaPS' pubcrawl (when they went by the name Thinking CaPS).

## FUCS Charity Pub Crawl for Ukraine

Shirt designs & advertising for a charity pub crawl run by the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The design was based on a rough sketch by the club president. The images are as follows: a slide, a poster, a social media route announcement image, a facebook banner, a shirt design for guests, a general social media square, and a shirt design for event organisers. Note that the route was later updated, but this was after others began running more aspects of the event (such as the branding).

## FLASC SWOTVAC Study Sessions

Branding materials for regular study sessions run by the FLinders Academic Science Club. The initial designs were made in Inkscape, then exported as separate components (e.g. title, border, background, textbox, etc) and reconstructed in Canva, so that others could easily the body text/etc each semester. A combination of blank templates, and complete 2023 Semester 1 designs, are shown here. The FLASC logo & science-related glyphs were made by others beforehand, while the rest was new. The designs are, in order: A TV slide, an a4 poster, 6x social media squares, 2x blank name badges, and 3x A4 signs placed on the tables for different subjects.

## FLASC thankyou certificates

Certificates made as a thankyou for outgoing club board members. The vertical lines of science-related glyphs were made in Inkscape, and then the rest was made in Google Sheets (!). Each person's details were entered as one row in a spreadsheet, then a formula was used to select a row via a dropdown, and then finally the info from that row was displayed with fancy fonts etc, ready to export as a PDF. These were printed on light-golden certificate paper, so took on that background colour while the digital files had a transparent background. A solid brown background colour has been artificially added to the examples below instead.
