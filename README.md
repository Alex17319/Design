### FUCS Glyphs

This is a collection of computing-related icons made for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The bugs are intended as graphics for any debugging-themed events. Individual SVGs and PNGs of each are available, and all are free to use under the WTFPL.

### FUCS Facebook Banner

The 2022 Facebook banner for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The blue version was created by me, with significant feedback from others to guide each step of the process. The green & purple version was produced via later modifications by the club president.

### FUCS and FLASC Table Banners

Banners for the Flinders Uni Computer Society and FLinders Academic Science Club, to suspend above their stalls at O'Week and other similar events. FUCS' banner was made as an SVG with Inkscape, while FLASC's banner was made in Canva. Both were ordered together to reduce costs, printed on coreflute, with several copies made at no additional cost. The logo and background-glyphs for FLASC's banner were made by others, though I was involved in converting them to SVGs/etc and cleaning up the resulting messy files.

### FUCS Merchandise

Merchandise organised for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. I heard the slogan from someone else, forgot who, and then everyone I asked said it wasn't them. The designs for the front & back were developed by me with significant feedback from others to guide each step of the process, and the merch was printed by Topline Promotions on AS Colour clothes in a variety of colours & sizes (only some are shown here).
