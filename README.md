# Design
A collection of graphic design assets I've made for various projects

## FUCS Glyphs

This is a collection of computing-related icons made for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The bugs are intended as graphics for any debugging-themed events. Individual SVGs and PNGs of each are also available.

## FUCS Facebook Banner

The 2022 Facebook banner for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The blue version was created by me, with significant feedback from others to guide each step of the process. The green & purple version was produced via later modifications by the club president. The font used is a modified version of Audiowide by Brian J. Bonislawsky, licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

## FUCS and FLASC Table Banners

Banners for the Flinders Uni Computer Society and FLinders Academic Science Club, to suspend above their stalls at O'Week and other similar events. FUCS' banner was made as an SVG with Inkscape, while FLASC's banner was made in Canva. Both were ordered together to reduce costs, printed on coreflute, with several copies made at no additional cost. The logo and background-glyphs for FLASC's banner were made by others, though I was involved in converting them to SVGs/etc and cleaning up the resulting messy files.

## FUCS Merchandise

Merchandise organised for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. I heard the slogan from someone else, forgot who, and then everyone I asked said it wasn't them. The designs for the front & back were developed by me with significant feedback from others to guide each step of the process, and the merch was printed by Topline Promotions on AS Colour clothes in a variety of colours & sizes (only some are shown here).

## FLASC Merchandise

Merchandise organised for the FLinders Academic Science Club. Two other designs were also printed, however they were primarily developed by others, with my only jobs being to convert them to SVG format so they could be printed, test out different colours, make previews, etc. This design was developed by me, with feedback from others along the way, and was based on the existing FLASC logo seen in the table-banner above. The multi-coloured colour scheme was adapted from the designs used for the club's 2019 'Drinking CaPS' pubcrawl (when they went by the name Thinking CaPS).

## FUCS Studying!

Adverstising for a study session run by the Flinders Uni Computer Society, in poster/slide/social-media formats. Assembled in Canva from components made using Inkscape. The computer character/mascot was made previously by others in the club.

## FUCS Charity Pub Crawl for Ukraine

Shirt designs & advertising for a charity pub crawl run by the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The design was based on a rough sketch by the club president. The first two images are shirt designs, the third is a poster, and the fourth is a facebook banner.
