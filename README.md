A collection of graphic design assets I've made for various projects

### FUCS Glyphs

This is a collection of computing-related icons made for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The bugs are intended as graphics for any debugging-themed events. Individual SVGs and PNGs of each are available, and all are free to use under the WTFPL.

### FUCS Facebook Banner
