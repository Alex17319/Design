# Design
A collection of graphic design assets I've made for various projects. For the most part, these are shown in chronological order, from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom.

## FLASC hallway banner

Hanging hallway banner (2.4m wide) made for the FLinders Academic Science Club, to replace our existing banner from when we went by the name Thinking CaPS. The design was made in Inkscape, with detailed feedback from others, and with CMYK conversion performed using Krita (RGB versions are shown here). Below the design is the existing Thinking CaPS design, which the new one was based on.

## FUCS Glyphs

This is a collection of computing-related icons made for the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The bugs are intended as graphics for any debugging-themed events. Individual SVGs and PNGs of each are also available.

## FLASC Quiz Nights

Advertising for Quiz Nights in 2023 and 2024. Trivia cards were printed and handed out to advertise the quiz night. Animated TV slides were made each year, showing the same trivia cards (low-res/low-framerate GIFs are shown below). Static TV slides or instagram posts were also made each year, e.g. for screens that couldn't support showing a video.

## FLASC Merchandise (2022)

Merchandise organised for the FLinders Academic Science Club. Two other designs were also embroidered, however they were primarily developed by others, with my only jobs being to convert them to SVG format so they could be embroidered, test out different colours, make previews, etc. This design was developed by me, with feedback from others along the way, and was based on an existing blue FLASC logo. The multi-coloured colour scheme was adapted from the designs used for the club's 2019 'Drinking CaPS' pubcrawl (when they went by the name Thinking CaPS).

## FLASC Lab Brat Pub Crawl

Branding materials and shirts (etc) for a pub crawl in late 2024, run by the FLinders Academic Science Club. Designs were made in Inkscape, and most shirts etc were sold through Redbubble. Custom retro-reflective tank tops were dyed at home, and then hand-cut anti-reflective letters were ironed on. The images shown are as follows: social media images sent in one post (7 total), a route announcement post, a route update post, a temporary profile picture used by the club while adevertising the event, a cryptic poster put up around campus with only a QR code for more info, custom-made tank tops, merch sold via Redbubble, and a modified copy of the club's existing periodic table.

The green & purple version was produced via later modifications by the club president. The font used is a modified version of Audiowide by Brian J. Bonislawsky, licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

## FUCS and FLASC Table Banners

Banners for the Flinders Uni Computer Society and FLinders Academic Science Club, to suspend above their stalls at O'Week and other similar events. FUCS' banner was made as an SVG with Inkscape, while FLASC's banner was made in Canva. Both were ordered together to reduce costs, printed on coreflute, with several copies made at no additional cost. The logo and background-glyphs for FLASC's banner were made by others, though I was involved in converting them to SVGs/etc and cleaning up the resulting messy files.

## FLASC SWOTVAC Study Sessions

Branding materials for regular study sessions run by the FLinders Academic Science Club. The initial designs were made in Inkscape, then exported as separate components (e.g. title, border, background, textbox, etc) and reconstructed in Canva, so that others could easily the body text/etc each semester. A combination of blank templates, and complete 2023 Semester 1 designs, are shown here. The FLASC logo & science-related glyphs were made by others beforehand, while the rest was new. The designs are, in order: A TV slide, an a4 poster, 6x social media squares, 2x blank name badges, and 3x A4 signs placed on the tables for different subjects.

## FUCS Charity Pub Crawl for Ukraine

Shirt designs & advertising for a charity pub crawl run by the Flinders Uni Computer Society. The design was based on a rough sketch by the club president. The images are as follows: a slide, a poster, a social media route announcement image, a facebook banner, a shirt design for guests, a general social media square, and a shirt design for event organisers. Note that the route was later updated, but this was after others began running more aspects of the event (such as the branding).

<img src="FUCS - Ukraine Pub Crawl/Slide v6.png" alt="Presentation slide: Yellow text on blue, surrounded by some other graphics, and reading 'Russian warship, go FUCS yourself.

## FLASC general posters

Posters made for the FLinders Academic Science Club. Both advertise the club to all students - the square one is intended for general member signups, while the rectangular one is intended to attract potential new board/exec members. Both designs were made in Inkscape, with feedback from others along the way. The logo & science-glyphs were made by others previously, while the text inside the hexagons was based on one of the club's old Facebook banners.
